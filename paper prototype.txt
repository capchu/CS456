Task 1: Check to see if your friend Barry has the movie Inception. Request it from him.

He expected his friends list to be under the list of "my lists" at first didn't see the bottom and clicked to create a new list for friends. When he saw the thing at the bottom he tried to use the place where it says "My Friends" as a search bar to type in Barry's Name. (not entirely sure if we planned on having that work)
